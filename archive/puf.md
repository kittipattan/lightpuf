Group authentication using PUFs involves verifying the collective authenticity of multiple devices in a group rather than authenticating each device individually. This approach can be particularly useful in scenarios where devices need to work together securely, such as in IoT networks, sensor networks, or distributed systems.

Here's how group authentication using PUFs can be implemented:

### Concept of Group Authentication Using PUFs

1. **Group Identifier:** Each device in the group shares a common group identifier. This identifier is used to link the devices within the same group.

2. **Group Challenge-Response Pairs (GCRPs):** Instead of individual CRPs, the group generates collective responses based on group-specific challenges. ###

### Implementation

Steps 1. **Enrollment Phase:**

**Individual PUF Enrollment:** Each device’s PUF is initialized, and its individual CRPs are collected and stored securely. –

**Group Formation:** Devices are assigned to a group, and a group identifier is generated. The group identifier is associated with each device in the group.

- **Group Challenge Generation:** A unique challenge is created for the group. This challenge can be a function of the group identifier and a nonce (random number).

- **Group Response Calculation:** Each device in the group responds to the group challenge using its PUF. These individual responses are then aggregated (e.g., using XOR or other aggregation functions) to form a collective group response.

- **Group Response Storage:** The aggregated group responses are securely stored in the authentication server’s database.

1. **Authentication Phase:**

- \*\*Group Challenge Issuance: When the group needs to be authenticated, the server sends a group-specific challenge.

- \*\*Individual Response Generation: Each device in the group generates a response to the group challenge using its PUF.
- \*\*Group Response Aggregation: The individual responses are aggregated to form a collective group response.
- \*\*Response Verification: The aggregated group response is sent to the authentication server. The server compares it with the stored group response. If they match, the group is authenticated.

### Advantages of Group Authentication Using PUFs

**Efficiency**: Reduces the overhead of authenticating each device individually, especially in large networks. –

**Scalability**: Easier to manage and scale authentication processes for groups of devices. –

**Security:** Enhances security by ensuring that all devices in a group are genuine and can collectively authenticate themselves.

### Techniques for Aggregating Responses

1. **XOR Aggregation:** - Simple and fast method where individual PUF responses are XORed to produce the group response. - \( \text{Group Response} = \text{Response}\_1 \oplus \text{Response}\_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus \text{Response}\_n \)

2. **Concatenation and Hashing:** - Individual responses are concatenated and then hashed to produce a fixed-length group response. - \( \text{Group Response} = \text{Hash}(\text{Response}\_1 || \text{Response}\_2 || \ldots || \text{Response}\_n) \)

3. **Threshold Schemes:** - Use techniques like Shamir’s Secret Sharing to ensure that only a subset of responses is needed to authenticate the group. - Useful in scenarios where not all devices in the group may be operational at all
